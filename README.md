# CS300-Projects

This program is designed to read a csv file of course data and store the data in a binary search tree, which the user
can interact with to print out an ordered list of courses or search for specific courses and their pre-requisites.

I struggled to implement the parser as a class. I couldn't wrap my head around the parser as a sum
of different parts, and so I went ahead and implemented it in main(). After I did this, it made it easier to understand
how I could go about breaking down the parsing into smaller functions that made up a class. I think with a better plan
before coding, or taking my pseudocode and building a class-type pseudocode, would have helped me get through this part
with less trouble.
